Imagine being trapped… unable to move, unable to speak… but fully aware.

This is the reality of catatonic schizophrenia—a rare and chilling disorder that holds its victims still, like statues, locked in a silence they can’t escape.

Some stay motionless for hours, even days… frozen, as though their own body has turned against them. Others seem to lose their will, responding to commands without question, like puppets with invisible strings.

But all the while… they hear voices. Soft whispers, demanding commands, relentless echoes… sounds that fill their minds. They want to respond, want to escape… but they’re trapped, locked away inside.

And then, without warning… chaos. An eruption of movement—unpredictable, wild, beyond control.

A mind imprisoned, a body beyond reach… haunted by voices they can’t silence.

This is catatonic schizophrenia… a chilling prison of the mind.
