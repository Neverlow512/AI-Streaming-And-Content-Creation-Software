# AI Content Creator - Current Status Report

## Current Implementation State (v0.1.0)
Three-component parallel processing system:
- Content generation (Ollama/LLM)
- Audio synthesis (TTS)
- Stream management

## System Specifications
- CPU: Intel i9-13900k
- RAM: 128GB DDR5
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080

This hardware configuration supports:
- Multiple parallel content generation streams
- High-quality TTS processing
- Potential for GPU acceleration
- Large context windows for LLM

## Current Issues

### 1. Content Generation Timing
```log
ERROR:content_generator:Error getting next segment
WARNING:content_generator:Generated empty content, retrying...
```
Problem: Content generator losing synchronization with audio playback
Impact: Interrupted speech, gaps in content
Cause: Thread timing and buffer management issues

### 2. Audio Playback Interruption
Problem: Audio stops when new content starts generating
Impact: Choppy, incomplete playback
Cause: Improper thread prioritization and queue management

### 3. Threading Issues
Problem: Race conditions between content generation and playback
Impact: System instability and poor performance
Cause: Inadequate thread synchronization

## Immediate Fix Recommendations

1. Content Generation
```python
# Increase buffer sizes to utilize available RAM
self.text_queue = Queue(maxsize=5)  # More content buffering
self.audio_queue = Queue(maxsize=5)  # More audio buffering

# Add proper thread synchronization
self.generation_lock = threading.Lock()
self.playback_event = threading.Event()
```

2. Audio Processing
```python
# Implement non-blocking audio playback
with sd.OutputStream(...) as stream:
    while not self.stop_event.is_set():
        if self.audio_queue.not_empty:
            # Process next audio segment while current one plays
```

3. Thread Management
- Implement proper state management
- Add content buffering
- Improve error recovery
- Add graceful shutdown

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Chat)
1. Fix thread synchronization
2. Implement proper content buffering
3. Add comprehensive state tracking
4. Improve error handling

### Future Development (Next Chat)
1. GPU acceleration for TTS
2. Character system implementation
3. Enhanced audio processing
4. Stream metrics and monitoring
